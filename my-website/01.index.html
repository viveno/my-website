        <h2> About Me!</h2>
        <h3> Intro </h3>
        <p>Hi! I’m Peter Farrell, a passionate and motivated professional in Web Development. I love tackling challenges, learning new skills, and collaborating with others to create meaningful results. I believe in combining hard work with a positive attitude, and I’m always eager to grow and contribute to exciting projects.</p>
        <h4> Work Experience </h4>
        <p> My work experience does not just inclucde wed design, before I got into web designing I have jobs that included things like working at ASDA as a Store Assisstant, NEXT as a distributor in their Warehouse, OCS as a Stock-Taker/Merchendiser and VivaMK as a catalogue distributor what I still do and love. </p>
        <h4> What Got Me into Web design? </h4>
        <p> I have always liked the idea of being able to code and being able to build coded websites, I have created a few websites in the past (without the need for code) one of my most recent ones being Viveno - a no algorithm Social Media Platform what you can find here (insert link code), I made it with no coding to start then I kept having ideas for features (these needed to be done with coding) so I looked into coding and after such a long time before looking into it thinking to myself I'm not going to be able to do coding its far too complicated my mindset changed after looking into it and saying to myself "you know what I could do that, I just need to learn it)< so i started to look into coding courses and the more I was learning about how coding worked with what went where the more I believed I could do it. I can say I'm very happy I did because everthing you see on here has been coded on. </p>    
        <h4> Coding Software I Have Used </h4>
        <p> To start with while I was learning the basics of coding I was using Google Sheets and App Scripts to create things using Code. If you have looked through Viveno you may have seen some of my features for example the One-Paste Post (on the Buy & Sell page) or The QR Code Scanner these were created with Google Sheets and App Scripts as well as a page I created for my VivaMK PDG catalogues what can be found (here). </p>
